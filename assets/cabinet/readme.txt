- since cabinet members are subjected to change after their term
of office, we had to create e naming convention to these pictures 

- all you need to do is note down the exact name and file extension 
of the current pictures (eg president.jpg). 

-after, delete this existing file and upload & rename your presidents
picture exactly like as shown above with its exact extension (eg new file should 
                                                              be renamed to president.jpg)

-do this f0r the rest of the cabinet pictures
